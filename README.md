Exploring project that combines Meteor authentication customization and CRUD collection api

The end goal is to be able to create/change Meteor user account upon RESTful request. 

This is particularly useful for people who runs a solution on multiple platforms, i.e. Meteor + RoR, Meteor + Laravel, etc...
